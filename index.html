      <p>Sometimes the world has a load of questions
        Seems like the world knows nothing at all
        The world is near, but it's out of reach
        Some people touch it, but they can't hold on
        She (night must fall, now!)
         (She has got to move the world)
        Is moving to describe the world(Darker! Darker!) (To move the world, to move the world)
        She (night must fall, now!) (She has got to move the world)
        Has messages for everyone(Darker! Darker!) (To move the world, to move the world)
        She (night must fall, now!) (She has got to move the world)
        Is moving by remote control(Darker! Darker!) (To move the world, to move the world)
        Hands (night must fall, now!) (She has got to move the world)
        That guide her are invisible(Darker! Darker!) (To move the world, to move the world)
        </p>

      <p>The world has a way of looking at people
        Sometimes we feel that the world is wrong
        She loves the world, and all the people in it
        She shakes 'em up when she start to walk
        Is only partly human being (so say so, so say so)(She wanna define) she (divine to define, she is moving to define)
        Defines the possibilities (so say so, so say so)(She wanna define) hol- (divine to define, she is moving to define)
        -Ding on for an eternity (so say so, so say so)(She wanna define) gone (divine to define, she is moving to define)
        The ending, without finishing (so say so, so say so)
        </p>

      <p>The world moves on a woman's hips
        The world moves, and it swivels and bops
        The world moves on a woman's hips
        The world moves, and it bounces and hops
        A world of light, she's gonna open our eyes up
        A world of light, she's gonna open our eyes up
        She gonna hold it, move it, (hold) hold it, move it
        Hold, move, hold, (hold) hold it, move it
        A world of light, she's gonna open our eyes up
        She (night must fall, now!) (She has got to move the world)Is moving to describe the world(Darker! Darker!) (To move the world, to move the world)
        She (night must fall, now!) (She has got to move the world)
        Has messages for everyone(Darker! Darker!) (To move the world, to move the world)
        She (night must fall, now!) (She has got to move the world)Is moving by remote control(Darker! Darker!) (To move the world, to move the world)
        Hands (night must fall, now!) (She has got to move the world)That guide her are invisible(Darker! Darker!) (To move the world, to move the world)
        World of light, she's gonna open our eyes up
        World of light, she's gonna open our eyes up
        She gonna hold it, move it, (hold) hold it, move it
        Hold, move, hold, (hold) hold it, move it
        World of light, she's gonna open our eyes up</p>
